## MPU9250
The MPU9250 combines both the MPU6500 and ak8963 libraries into a single wrapper library.
The MPU6500 provides the accelerometer and gyroscopic measurements.
The ak8963 provides the magnetometer measurements.

## Simply.py
`simply.py` is a simple test program to show current telemetry data from the sensor
`ak8962.py` is the magnetometer library, used by the mpu9250 library
`mpu6500.py` is the accelerometer and gyroscope library
`mpu9250.py` is the main library that comines all two libraries together
